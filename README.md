**YES!** Believe your JavaScript code can write just like ruby, and without using *any* ruby interpreters. JavaScript is your rb.

With this code, you can change your JavaScript syntax.   
I designed it and try to make JavaScript just like Ruby, and of course, with lots of thing that only JavaScript has.

Hope you have fun.
